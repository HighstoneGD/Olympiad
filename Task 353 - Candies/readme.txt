A little boy got into a fairyland and saw a road there, along which bags of candy were laid out. The amount of candy is written on each bag. The boy can take two bags in each hand, lying next to each other. What is the greatest amount of candy he can take?

Input data

The single line first sets the number of bags N (4 <= N <= 10,000), and then N numbers separated by a space — the number of candies in each bag (all numbers are non-negative and do not exceed 1,000,000).

Output

Print the only required number - the answer to the problem.
