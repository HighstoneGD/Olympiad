Artillery has always been a branch of the military, in which various counting devices were intensively used. Once they were mechanical and showed the results of calculations by means of wheels with painted numbers. However, progress did not stand still. Once designers have developed an electrical device that showed the results with the help of segment indicators - LEDs.
To start the progress, it is necessary to develop a program that, by a given number, determines the number of LEDs that must light up in order to correctly display the given number.

Input data

Specified number N (0 <= N <= 10^9)

Output

The desired number of LEDs.
