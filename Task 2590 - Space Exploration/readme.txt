Farmer John’s cows have finally launched from Earth and are now flying in their Mukraft. Cows want to reach their beloved relatives on the satellite of Jupiter Io, but for this they must first go through the dangerous asteroid belt.
Bessie pilots the ship through this treacherous n x n sector of space. Asteroids in this sector are represented by 1x1 squares and are stone blocks connected at the edges (two squares having only one common angle are considered two different asteroids). Please help Bessie climb through this field by counting the number of different asteroids in the entire sector.

Input data:
The first line contains one number n (1 ? n ? 1000). Starting from the second, (i + 1) -th line contains the i-th line of the field with asteroids: n characters.

Output:
Print the number of asteroids in the field.
